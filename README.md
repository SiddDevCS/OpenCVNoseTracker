# **NoseTracker :)**

**NoseTracker :)** is a fun real-time computer vision project that uses **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** to track your nose and create a glowing orb effect around it. The dot pulsates and changes color in response to the movement of your nose, giving it a cool interactive vibe!

## **Features**
- Tracks your **nose** in real-time using MediaPipeâ€™s face mesh.
- Draws a **pulsing, glowing orb** that follows your nose.
- **Smooth animation** with glowing trails.
- No extra assets required, just **Python libraries** and your webcam.
- Works in real-time with live video capture.

## **Requirements**

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- NumPy

### **Install Dependencies**
